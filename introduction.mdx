<img alt="Hero Light" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/hero-light.svg" />Unengineered is an umbrella company dedicated to designing and developing a cohesive ecosystem of hardware and software products for B2C markets, all grounded in a core philosophy of Productivity. Our products are purpose-built to excel at a single task with precision and perfection—without any unnecessary bloatware or frivolous features.

We believe in simplicity and functionality. Think of our approach like a hammer: its sole purpose is to drive a nail into the wall effectively. You don’t need a hammer that can make phone calls; you need one that is reliable, sturdy, and does its job impeccably.

At Unengineered, we eliminate distractions to create tools that work as they should—nothing more, nothing less.

## Why the need?

When I first created Thinker  [https://www.thinkerapp.org/](https://www.thinkerapp.org/)  it was a hobby project—a tool I built for my personal use. When I launched it on GitHub, it unexpectedly gained traction. Its popularity stemmed from doing one thing exceptionally well: note-taking. In a market overcrowded with bloated productivity apps, Thinker stood out because it was an honest product.

With zero marketing spend, sales began to pick up. Its success lay in its simplicity and transparency—qualities that are rare in today's market. If you visit the landing page, you'll see no false promises or unnecessary distractions. Thinker was designed for users to buy it and start using it immediately. It was my alternative to Notion, which I found to be an unnecessarily complicated replacement for a simple notebook.

Today, Thinker averages 200-page visits and 10–15 sales per month, an incredible conversion rate in a market dominated by over-complicated solutions. This success planted the seed for Unengineered.

In a world driven by constant short-interval stimulations, Unengineered aims to provide a haven of focus. Our philosophy is simple: create products that do exactly what they’re supposed to do—and nothing more.

**Take the Apple Watch,** for example. It can perform almost every task a phone can, but at the end of the day, its battery is often dead, failing at its core purpose: telling the time. The same goes for phones and software. Many tools today jump on trends like AI, adding features just for the sake of buzzwords. We saw this with blockchain when it was merely a decentralized database.

At Unengineered, we strip away the noise. True to our name, we "un-engineer" products to focus solely on productivity. Our vision is to build a hyper-minimal ecosystem of hardware and software solutions, starting with wearables.

Unengineered isn’t just a brand; it’s a philosophy—one that prioritizes functionality, simplicity, and an honest approach to technology.

## Why wearables?

To drive a significant habitual change in people, we believe the key lies in gradual transformation—breaking down entrenched notions one step at a time. At Unengineered, we aim to begin this journey with minimal-commitment products—affordable yet premium tools that introduce users to our philosophy of simplicity and focused design. These products will seamlessly integrate into your daily life, preparing you for the broader ecosystem of Unengineered solutions.

### The Product Lineup: First 5 Years

1. **Headphones and Ambient Sound Devices**
   Designed to deliver exceptional sound quality and simplicity, these products provide a focused and distraction-free auditory experience.

2. **Smart-Enough Watches**
   Purpose-built wearables that do exactly what you need, such as telling time and supporting essential digital functions, without unnecessary features that drain resources or focus.

All these products will seemlessly integrate with the existing echosystems of apple and android.

### Pricing and Experience

These products will cater to those seeking a premium experience, starting at ₹5,000. They represent an accessible entry point into the Unengineered ecosystem, allowing users to embrace our productivity-first philosophy.

### The Future Vision: 10-Year Horizon

The ultimate goal for Unengineered is to develop mobile phones—devices that truly embody our philosophy of minimalism and perfection. While this ambitious dream lies a decade ahead, the foundation is already being laid.

With every product we create, Unengineered strives to redefine how technology integrates into our lives: function over fluff, simplicity over spectacle.

## The Target audience

Let’s be honest—if you search for headphones or wearables on Amazon, you’ll find thousands of brands, many based right here in India. So why would Unengineered choose to enter such a saturated market?

The answer is simple: **Unengineered products aren’t for everyone.**

We design for an elite group of individuals who take their lives seriously and value their time above all else. These are people who seek tools that enhance their productivity without unnecessary distractions. That’s why Unengineered exists in a category of its own.

Take the Apple Watch as an example. It boasts a plethora of features—most of which you’ll rarely, if ever, use. Meanwhile, Unengineered’s watches focus on delivering exactly what you need them to do—and nothing you don’t. Imagine never having to glance at your wrist only to find a blank screen and then awkwardly ask someone else for the time. With Unengineered, your tools are reliable, focused, and built to serve their purpose impeccably.

We’re not here to compete in the crowded race of feature-packed gadgets. We’re here to create tools that prioritize your time and productivity, catering to those who understand the value of less, but better.

# Phase 1 - Headphones and ambient sound devices.

Unengineered is going to launch two products initially, Headphones and ambient sound devices, and Smart-enough watches. But Phase 1 of the launch will be only focused on Headphones.

### So what is this dream for headphones and ambient sound devices, and How is it different from the market?

I am not an electronic engineer but it is safe to say a Bluetooth audio device, be it headphones, speakers, etc are driven by these three things:

﻿

﻿

This is fundamental for all sound devices, with speaker and amp modules changing when it comes to how loud you want the sound to play, a low-wattage speaker for headphones, and high-wattage speaker for external Bluetooth speakers. This is why we have conceptualized a device called the omnipresence.&#x20;

﻿

![](https://feuocucckmxcdidzjrtf.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/030a995c-17c3-4266-8c3b-fffb63d189b8/bffad631-75d4-4529-948e-55b3517b3fab/cde13728-33da-414d-8326-2067df394f63-The-Omnipresence-png.png)

This is just an ideation, the end design will change significantly.

﻿

The omnipresence is a modular device that can be connected to different external speakers as well as directly be used as a headphone with its inbuilt speaker. The core fundamentals of the Sound devices is modularity. Take a look at how a headphone unit will look like:

﻿

And this is what a Bluetooth speaker will look like:

﻿

﻿

Or use it as ambient sound device:

﻿

![](https://feuocucckmxcdidzjrtf.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/030a995c-17c3-4266-8c3b-fffb63d189b8/bffad631-75d4-4529-948e-55b3517b3fab/991dfb2d-59f5-476c-a02a-0200dd0911bb-Screenshot-2025-01-10-at-9-28-39-PM-png.png)

﻿

Now if we put everything together to get a sense of what The omni device does is:

![](https://feuocucckmxcdidzjrtf.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/030a995c-17c3-4266-8c3b-fffb63d189b8/bffad631-75d4-4529-948e-55b3517b3fab/c4cc9fe9-03d1-4751-85d9-e06e060fe180-Screenshot-2025-01-10-at-9-19-32-PM-png.png)

The ambient noise module is still an idea - we need help from sound engineers to understand how to achieve the design.

﻿

To sump up the idea of Omni device, it basically has the essential controls and components to be used directly as a headphone, or connect to a bigger external speaker to operate as an external speaker module.

## What features does this Omni device have?

### General Features for Bluetooth Audio Receiving and Playback

## Aviation Series: The Aspirational Headphones

The Aviation Series is not just a product—it’s a statement. These headphones are designed to be brag-worthy, the kind of accessory that sparks envy and admiration among peers.

### Why Aviation?

Airports are synonymous with affluence. Let’s be honest—only high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) frequent these spaces. A common man is unlikely to invest ₹15,000–₹20,000 in headphones. **This is why the Aviation Series will be exclusively sold at airports.**

* Targeted Exclusivity: By positioning the product at airports, we effectively separate HNIs from the masses, creating a perfect environment for premium product placement.

* Influence Through Imagery: When these affluent individuals see airline pilots using the Aviation Series, they’ll be compelled to explore airport retail outlets and experience the product themselves.

### Sales and Distribution Strategy

* **Airport-Only Availability:** These headphones will not be available in offline stores, adding to their exclusivity.

* **Limited Drops:** Released in batches of 10,000 units every two months, creating scarcity and desirability.

### Crafting a Piece of History

What sets the Aviation Series apart is its heritage-inspired craftsmanship:

* Made from scrap metal of retired Indian fighter jets, each headphone will feature the chassis number of the aircraft engraved on it.

* Buyers will also receive the story of the specific jet whose parts were used, much like the Royal Enfield Signals Edition or the Bajaj V motorcycle made from the INS Vikrant.

* This isn’t just a product; it’s a piece of history—something to cherish and flaunt.

### Customization for Airline Pilots

Initially targeted at airline pilots, these headphones will offer unique personalization options:

* **Custom Engravings:** Pilots can have their identification numbers engraved on the headphones, enhancing their exclusivity.

* **Standout feature for pilots:** An analogue odometer that show total flytime hours of the pilot - the analogue meter is controlled through logging of air time through an app (Or partner app)

### Premium Features

* Ear Depressurization: Special technology to relieve ear pressure during flights, ensuring maximum comfort.

* **Custom Audio Announcements:** Inspired by quirky branding like *“You’ve plugged into Nirvana”* from other headphones, the Aviation Series will include tailored announcements with a radio crackle effect. Examples:

* *“Locked and Loaded, Captain.”*

* *“Welcome aboard, Commander.”*

### Packaging and Presentation

Every Aviation Series headphone will come with premium packaging that reinforces the narrative of owning a piece of history. This will include:

* The jet’s story as part of the unboxing experience.

* Thoughtful design elements that reflect the aviation heritage and premium craftsmanship.

### Still Under Development

The Aviation Series is being carefully designed to balance functionality, exclusivity, and heritage. Its over-the-top features, combined with the compelling narrative, will make it a standout product in the Unengineered lineup.

# Smart-Enough Watch: An Analogue Watch with Digital Essentials

This concept is still in its early stages, but the **Smart-Enough Watch** is envisioned as a blend of classic analogue design with carefully selected digital features. True to the Unengineered philosophy, it will focus only on the essential functionalities, offering a perfect balance of tradition and technology.

### **Core Digital Features**

1. **Call Notifications and Answering:** See who’s calling and have the option to answer directly from the watch.

2. **Activity Tracking:** Track basic fitness metrics like steps, distance, and calories to support an active lifestyle.

3. **SMS and Email Notifications:** Get notified of important messages without being overwhelmed by unnecessary distractions.

4. **Navigation Assistance:** Turn-by-turn directions displayed discreetly on the watch face for easy navigation.

5. **Music Control:** Play, pause, or skip tracks with simple controls right on your wrist. Only controls, no display to show song title, playlist etc. since it is unnecessary, every listener will already know what he is listening to.

### **Design Philosophy**

* The **analogue aesthetic** ensures timeless elegance, while the limited digital integration keeps the device focused and minimal.

* It’s a watch that does what you need—no more, no less.

This is a rough reference of an existing product in the market. This is similar to what the watch will look like, design will be completely different:
